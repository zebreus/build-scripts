# Python native modules for WASIX

## Python Index

You can use this index for WASIX easily by providing this index to `pip` or `uv`:
https://pythonindex.wasix.org/

### Using the index in your projects

The actual **Simple API** endpoint that pip/uv expect lives under the `simple/` path, so the full base URL is:

```
https://pythonindex.wasix.org/simple
```

Below are a few common ways to point your tooling at it.

#### pip (one-off)

Install a package **only** from the WASIX index (no PyPI fallback):

```bash
pip install --index-url https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple <package-name>
```

Keep the default PyPI index but let pip also search the WASIX index:

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple <package-name>
```

You can also set an environment variable once per shell:

```bash
export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple
pip install <package-name>
```

#### uv (one-off)

`uv` accepts the same flags as pip, so you can run e.g.:

```bash
# Only use the WASIX index
uv pip install --index-url https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple <package-name>

# Or combine with PyPI
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple <package-name>
```

#### uv (project configuration)

For a permanent, checked-in configuration add a custom index section to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
# A human-friendly name you pick
name = "wasix"
# The Simple index URL
url = "https://wasix-org.github.io/build-scripts/simple"
# Optional â€“ make this the primary index
default = true
```

After that, every `uv sync` / `uv pip install` inside the project will automatically resolve packages against the WASIX index.

### Rebuilding the index

All the supported native modules are already compiled in the [`artifacts/`](./artifacts) folder.
For each commit that changes the modules, we generate a new index using `dumb-pypi` that is statically stored in the provided URL index.

If you want to regenerate the index manually, you just need to do:

```bash
./generate-index.sh
```

## Building modules from source

Buildscripts to build numpy and other wheels for wasix. For convenience, this package already includes prebuilt versions of all the wheels and libraries.

### Usage

The build script is controlled by the following environment variables:

* `CC`, `CXX`, `AR`, `LD`, `RANLIB`, etc... : The cross-compiler tools. These should all be normal clang tools, but target wasm32-wasix by default and use the wasix sysroot.
* `WASIX_SYSROOT`: The path to the wasix sysroot that is used by the toolchain. Libraries will get installed here when you run `make install` or when they are required to build a package.
* `INSTALL_DIR`: The path to the python library path. Wheels will get installed here when you run `make install`.
* `WASMER`: The path to the wasmer binary. You must have it registered to handle wasm files as binfmt_misc. You can do this with `sudo $WASMER binfmt reregister`.

The easiest way to setup all the environment variables is to activate the wasix-clang environment using `source wasix-clang/activate`.

Then you can run `make all` to build all wheels and libraries.

### Notes

All built library packages should include a pkg-config file for each library.

#### [Variables in pkg-config files](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html)

When building libs, we should make shour they include pkg-config files. The pkg config files should have their prefix set to `/usr/local`, exec_prefix set to `${prefix}`, libdir set to `${exec_prefix}/lib/wasm32-wasi`, and includedir set to `${prefix}/include`. In some cases it might be acceptable to have exec_prefix hardcoded to the same value as prefix. In that case libdir should start with `${prefix}` instead of `${exec_prefix}`.

### Analyzing the output

#### Check whether python libaries require shared libs

You can run somethign like

```bash
for f in $(find "$INSTALL_DIR" -name '*.so') ; do echo $f ; wasm-tools print $f | head -n10 | grep '(needed' -C10 ; done
```

to check which python libraries depend on shared libs. We try to keep that to a minimum, so wheels contain everything that is required to use a package.
